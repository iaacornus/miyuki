# Guidelines

Since machine learning models with incomplete, specifically flawed data potentially can have a significant amount of grave problems, especially malignant stereotyping [1], the data that will be submitted should be reviewed first. The preliminary criteria is as defined below:

1. The data should not contain any material that discriminates, which includes (1.) Race; and (2.) Religion. Since the model is a stupid model that is based on anime materials, sex is not intentionally discriminated in the context. Therefore, the data should not mention or pertain any implication regarding the race and religion of the main subject.
2. The data should be complete and should not contain any heavy NSFW information, borderline NSFW maybe tolerated.
3. The data should not be subject to copyright, and should have permission of use with the author.
4. The data should not be repetitive, and should be new (not already existing), although if the data contains revision of the current entry, maybe considered.
